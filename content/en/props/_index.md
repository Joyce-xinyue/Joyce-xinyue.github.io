**Concept and Rules I Decided**  

**Two hard rules:** large enough for an adult inside and 90% recycled materials. I sketched the draft‚Äîfridge carton sideways, mouth opening, performer‚Äôs head as pistil‚Äîall later measures based on this.


**Material Hunt I Did the Legwork**  
I checked five fridge cartons, kept one over 7 mm thick. Gathered 32 square bottles from neighbors, used bases as teeth. Collected 40 pallet boards, nail-free, and 3 square meters of polyester sheet from a donation bin.


**Flower Skeleton ‚Äî I Built Four Systems**  
Standing cabin 45 cm wide to fit shoulders. Anti-collapse ribs: bottles over corners, jump-tested at 70 kg. Back door 60 cm with Velcro exit in 3 seconds. Ventilation: 20 straw stamens for airflow and photo-friendliness.


**Petal Tech ‚Äî My Bottle Edge Invention**  
Cut sheet into six 50 cm petals, glued bottle bases for rigid curl, tied each petal with cable ties‚Äîassembly in 5 minutes.


**Wood Back Wall ‚Äî My No-New-Nails Rule**  
Boards interlock with 5 mm slots, no nails. Natural stains from coffee and red cabbage. Marked each jar ratio for matching. Touched up with a signed mini flower sketch in the corner.


**Safety and Comfort ‚Äî I Tested**  
100 kg load‚Äîno bulge. 50 N side kick‚Äîjoints intact. 30-minute heat test‚Äîtemperature rise under 2 degrees.


**Green Score ‚Äî I Counted**  
**Budget:** zero. Fully reclaimed. Build time: eight hours (six and a half by me). Strike time: fifteen minutes. All parts flat-packed under 0.1 cubic meters recycled.

From idea, material scouting, and sketches to testing, every key action was mine. This flower speaks with my voice.

<p class="props-red-text">Researching women‚Äôs fashion in the context of historical trends--From Victorian era to Jazz Age</p>


<p class="props-red-text">Tim Burton‚Äôs Corpse Bride uses Victorian-era fashion to show social status and personality.</p>

**Costumes in Corpse Bride: The Vitality of the Dead vs. The Stiffness of the Living**  

In Tim Burton‚Äôs Corpse Bride, costumes visually contrast the vitality of the dead with the rigidity of the living, reflecting character traits and emotional states.

**Emily ‚Äì Passion & Vitality of the Dead:** Emily‚Äôs ghostly wedding dress, though tattered, is layered with flowing lace and silk. The movement and intricate details convey her enduring passion, romantic longing, and emotional vibrancy, despite her death. Her expressive costume highlights devotion and the vitality of her spirit.

**Victoria ‚Äì Courage & Restraint of the Living:** Victoria‚Äôs dresses are stiff, neatly tailored, and light-colored, emphasizing modesty, social propriety, and composure. The restrained silhouette reflects her courage and moral steadfastness within the rigid norms of Victorian society.

**Color & Texture Symbolism:**  Emily: deep blues, grays, and torn textures = emotional depth, freedom, and supernatural vitality.  

**Victoria:** soft pastels, smooth fabrics = life constrained by societal expectations, decorum, and restraint.

**Movement & Silhouette:** Flowing layers on Emily‚Äôs costume suggest openness and emotion, contrasting with Victoria‚Äôs structured skirts and tight bodice that symbolize societal control and internal restraint.

<p class="props-red-text">Women‚Äôs Costumes in Little Women: Personality and Social Status in Civil War-Era America</p>  

In Little Women, clothing reflects both personality and social position within a middle-class family during the American Civil War.

**Silhouette & Practicality:** Everyday dresses feature modest bodices and full skirts, often made of cotton or wool, suitable for domestic tasks. These practical silhouettes reveal the sisters‚Äô active lives and middle-class status.

**Meg March ‚Äì Elegance & Aspiration:** Meg wears slightly more refined fabrics and subtle embellishments, reflecting her desire for higher social status and adherence to conventional femininity. Her dresses suggest grace and domestic ambition.

**Jo March ‚Äì Independence & Nonconformity:** Jo favors simple, durable fabrics with minimal decoration. Her plain, practical attire highlights her rebellious nature, independence, and focus on writing rather than social appearances.

**Beth March ‚Äì Modesty & Gentleness:** Beth‚Äôs clothing is soft, light-colored, and unadorned, reflecting her shy, gentle, and nurturing personality. Her attire emphasizes humility and domestic virtue.

**Amy March ‚Äì Fashion & Social Ambition:** Amy often wears ribbons, small lace trims, and light pastel colors, signaling her concern with beauty, social image, and future societal status. Her attire demonstrates ambition within socially accepted norms.

**Color & Fabric Symbolism:** Light colors = youth, purity, and domestic virtue. Muted/durable fabrics = practicality and middle-class life. Embellishments = personality traits and aspirations.


**Women in The Great Gatsby: Glamour, Objectification, and Illusory Freedom**  

F. Scott Fitzgerald‚Äôs The Great Gatsby portrays 1920s women under the veneer of wealth and glamour, highlighting the tension between perceived freedom and societal constraints.

**Appearance & Glamour:**  

Female characters wear luxurious dresses, pearls, and fashionable accessories. Daisy‚Äôs flowing gowns and Jordan‚Äôs stylish attire emphasize beauty, elegance, and social visibility.

**Objectification & Male Gaze:**  

Despite glamorous appearances, women are often observed and judged by men. Their value is tied to charm, status, and physical appeal rather than personal agency.

**False Prosperity:**  

Lavish parties, glittering jewelry, and extravagant lifestyles create a sense of freedom, masking dependence on male wealth and societal expectations.

**Illusory Freedom:**  

Women are called ‚Äúmodern‚Äù or ‚Äúfree,‚Äù yet their choices are constrained by social norms, marriage prospects, and male desire. Their autonomy is largely performative.
