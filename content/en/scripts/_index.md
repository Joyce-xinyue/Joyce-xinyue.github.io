### Corpse Bride

I made the following key adaptations and personal touches to heighten theatricality, emotional clarity, and symbolic resonance on stage.

### Split Screen Staging: Living vs Dead Worlds

**Change:** Instead of blackouts between scenes, I used a split stage design. The right side remains the rigid, candle-lit Victorian parlor chapel, while the left side transforms into the mossy, fog-drenched forest Underworld, in full view of the audience.

**Purpose:** To visually juxtapose the suffocating living world with the chaotic freedom of the dead, allowing Victor to literally walk from one existence into another without interrupting the narrative flow.

### The Ring on a Twig Moment — A Micro Marriage

**Change:** When Victor practices his vows, he places a makeshift twig ring onto what he believes is a tree stump, revealed to be Emily’s skeletal finger.

**Personal Touch:** I extended the silence after the ring is placed to five full seconds, with wind machines abruptly stopping to create a vacuum of sound, making the audience feel the moment death accepts the proposal.

**Symbolism:** The twig—a dead object—becomes a living contract, reversing the traditional “till death do us part” vow. 

### Emily’s Waiting — The 10 Second Heartbeat

**Change:** After Victor abandons Emily in the Underworld, I added a 10-second freeze where Emily stands alone, holding her breath, staring at the exit Victor took.

**Direction:** During these 10 seconds, the entire cast freezes mid-movement, even background spirits, and a single heartbeat sound is played through the speakers, slowing down until it stops when Emily lowers her head.

**Effect:** This suspends time, forcing the audience to feel the weight of being left at the altar again.

### Dried Flowers — Love Without Life

**Change:**  When Victor returns to Emily, he brings a bouquet of dried flowers instead of fresh ones.

**Reasoning:** In the Underworld, nothing living can survive, so even his apology must be dead. The flowers crumble slightly when Emily touches them, symbolizing that love here is fragile—preserved but never growing.

**Contrast:** Later, when Emily releases Victor, she returns the twig ring and places a single dried petal in Victoria’s hand, transferring the right to love, not the love itself.


### Butterfly Transformation — Paper and Air

**Change:**  Instead of CGI butterflies, I used paper butterfly confetti shot from hand-cranked air cannons hidden in the chapel pews.

**Timing:** As Emily says, “Now I can do the same for you,” the lights shift to icy blue and the paper butterflies erupt upward—but fall back down halfway, never reaching the moon.

**Meaning:** The failed ascent visually reminds the audience that Emily’s soul is still earthbound. Her freedom is not transcendence, but release from expectation.

### Emily’s Last Line — Spoken to the Audience

**Change:**  Emily’s final line, “You set me free,” is delivered directly to the audience, not Victor.

**Lighting:** A single spotlight hits Emily’s face as she removes her veil, revealing a small living flower tucked behind her ear—the only living thing in the Underworld.

**Implication:** The freedom she gains is not from death, but from being watched. She returns the gaze to the audience, asking, “Will you still love me when I’m no longer your tragedy?”

These changes turn a gothic fairy tale into a ritual about performative grief, where marriage, death, and redemption are all stage-managed acts—and the only true love is the one that releases, not possesses.

### The Great Gatsby

I made some modifications and design ideas to strengthen dramatic conflict, deepen motivation, and reconstruct the collapse of the American Dream through visual symbols.

### Narrative Frame — Confession from a Psychiatric Ward

**Change:** I turned Nick’s narration into a therapy session in a psychiatric hospital.

**Part 1:** The stage projects snow-like static to symbolize fragmented memory. The doctor becomes the audience surrogate, questioning Nick’s complicity.

**Idea:** Through the unreliable narrator device, Nick’s confession doubles as self-justification. The cold snow visual contrasts the warmth of Gatsby’s green light, foreshadowing frozen hope.

### Feminine Awakening — Daisy’s Green Light Revenge

**Change:** After the car accident (Part 10), Daisy turns to the audience holding a broken headlight shard, reflecting green light on Gatsby. She says, “Your love was the nail that pinned me to your altar.”

**Idea:** Daisy’s passivity becomes active judgment. The green light turns from symbol of faith to weapon of female gaze. Gatsby’s fragmented reflection suggests the shattering of his idealized self.


### Death Ritual — The Pool as Baptism and Water Torture

**Change:** In Gatsby’s death scene (Part 11), blue lightning and dry ice were used to create visual effects of the pool. 

**Idea:** The “water” turns champagne gold, recalling earlier parties and linking Nick’s line, “They’re all worth less than you,” with poisoned glamour. Wilson’s shadow above the pool completes the divine trial metaphor.

### Music— Jazz Disenchantment

**Change:** Live jazz becomes an off-key version of Young and Beautiful, slowing to warped tape noise at the climax, echoing eerie dreamlike soundtracks.

**Idea:** The collapse of sound deconstructs 1920s euphoria, turning jazz into an obituary. When Gatsby and Daisy reunite, silence lasts 10 seconds—the vacuum forces the audience to hear their own accelerated breathing, becoming accomplices.


### Audience Complicity — The Flashlight Funeral

**Change:** In Gatsby’s funeral (Part 12), the audience is told to turn on their phone flashlights, lighting an empty coffin. Nick asks, “Is your light for mourning or for posting?”

**Idea:** Digital vanity mirrors 1920s social climbing. The flashing cold light echoes the green light, showing that every Gatsby is fed by spectators’ gaze.

These changes use material violence, deconstruction, feminine retribution, and forced audience awareness to turn the corruption of the American Dream into a crime still happening live on stage.

### Pirates of the Caribbean

I modify the original script, which is the film lines, to sharpen moral stakes, heighten theatricality, and make the chest of souls a living judge.

### Split Stage — Brand new technique for BCA drama

**First time the audience are included in the story:** Will, Jack, and Norrington were involved in a wheel fight in the film. As the original fight is too dangerous for us to emulate, I decided to move the fight scene to the audience area to make viewers engage. 

**How:** Actors break the boundary between stage and audience by rushing down the aisles, using the entire theatre as their battleground. The wheel becomes symbolic—represented by a rotating light pattern that follows them—while sound effects and quick lighting shifts simulate motion and chaos. Audience members will feel the tension up close, ducking as swords flash past and hearing the actors’ breaths, turning passive viewers into participants in the storm.

### Elizabeth’s Fourth Wall Jury

At the climax, Elizabeth invites the audience to raise phone lights to decide who deserves the chest. Stage lights shift color to match the majority: gold for Will, red for Jack, white for Norrington. The crowd must declare its bias.

### Jack’s Final Cheat — The Jar of Dirt as Pass-the-Parcel

Jack’s jar of dirt becomes a bucket passed through the front row. When opened, black confetti spills, marking spectators as cursed—collapsing pirate and audience boundaries.

This stage adaptation heightens moral tension and turns the audience into active participants through immersive staging. From the cursed jar to wheel fight, spectators become part of the pirates’ chaos.

### Little Women

My modifications turns the coming-of-age stories into a memory ritual where the audience can handle the sisters’ dreams and regrets.

### Amy’s Revenge — Onstage Book Ripping

When Amy burns Jo’s manuscript, every tear is heard through a microphone fan—each rip like a gunshot. Pages swirl in an onstage paper storm, childhood anger turned into snow.

### Beth’s Piano String — Visible Music

Beth’s piano becomes a single harp string across the proscenium. She bows it, casting blue ripples. When she weakens, Jo bows instead. The sound flatlines until Meg cuts the wire—ending her life in a visible, audible snap.

### The Final Tableau — A Living Photograph

Instead of a curtain call, the four sisters freeze as the famous Alcott photo slowly colorizes. The turntable spins once more, stopping at a blank white spring quadrant.

These devices keep Alcott’s heart but let the audience feel time, grief, and ambition as tangible. Every viewer lends a dream, rescues a sister, or writes a line to Jo’s book—the March family expands to include the whole theater.
