Over the past three years, Joyce has led British Columbia Academy‚Äôs only official drama club as leader and Head of the Art Department, overseeing prop design, visual concept creation, and stage aesthetics. 

As both a performer and playwright, she has contributed to major productions including Little Women (2024), The Great Gatsby (2025), Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man‚Äôs Chest (wheel fight scene adaptation) (2025), and Little Shop of Horrors (2024). She possesses excellent vocal skills and a deep understanding of her characters‚Äô personalities, always delivering her best performance to the audience. Each semester, her productions have been featured in school-wide showcases and on the official WeChat platform during the annual recruitment season.
As a strict yet gentle leader, Joyce excels at managing actors‚Äô rehearsal schedules. She supervised script production, direction, and rehearsal progress for musical and theatrical works such as Little Shop of Horrors (2024), Moana (2025), Frozen (2025), and The Greatest Showman (2026). She also trains actors in vocal skills and discusses her understanding of the characters with fellow performers.
As the Head of the Art Department in the club, she is involved in nearly every aspect of set and prop creation‚Äîfrom the giant mouth of Little Shop of Horrors and its backing wall to the faux rocks and plastic trees for Corpse Bride. She excels at creating the most suitable and high-quality stage sets and props with minimal budget. At the same time, to raise funds, she runs small businesses during school events and donates the surplus to stray animal protection organizations.

Upholding the philosophy of bringing theatre to everyone, Joyce blends performance with artistry and cinematic imagination, continually pushing the boundaries between storytelling and stagecraft.
